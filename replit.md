## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built using React 18 with TypeScript, leveraging modern React patterns and hooks for state management. The UI is constructed using shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, providing a consistent and accessible design system. Styling is handled through Tailwind CSS with a custom design token system for theming and responsive design.

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with clear separation between presentational and container components. React Query (TanStack Query) manages server state and caching, while a custom authentication context provides user session management across the application. Routing is implemented using Wouter for lightweight client-side navigation.

### Backend Architecture
The server-side application uses Express.js with TypeScript in an ESM environment. The architecture follows a modular approach with separate concerns for routing, database operations, and business logic. Authentication is handled through Express sessions with PostgreSQL-backed session storage, providing persistent login states across browser sessions.

The API layer implements RESTful endpoints with role-based access control middleware. Request validation is performed using Zod schemas, ensuring type safety from the database layer through to the frontend. The server includes comprehensive logging and error handling middleware for production reliability.

### Database Layer
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The database schema is designed with proper normalization and includes tables for users, partners, products, fulfillment requests, pricing tiers, and analytics. Database migrations are managed through Drizzle Kit with automatic schema generation.

The data layer implements a storage abstraction pattern, providing a clean interface between business logic and database operations. This design allows for easy testing and potential database provider changes while maintaining type safety throughout the application stack.

### Authentication & Authorization
Session-based authentication is implemented using express-session with PostgreSQL storage via connect-pg-simple. The system supports role-based access control with admin and partner user types, each having specific permissions and access levels. Authentication state is managed through a React context provider with automatic session validation.

Password security is handled using bcryptjs for hashing, and session cookies are configured for production security including httpOnly and secure flags. The authentication flow includes registration, login, logout, and automatic session restoration across browser sessions.

### State Management
Client-side state management follows a hybrid approach using React Query for server state and React Context for application state. This pattern minimizes prop drilling while maintaining clear data flow and enabling efficient caching of API responses. Form state is managed locally within components using controlled inputs and validation schemas.

The application implements optimistic updates for better user experience, with proper error handling and rollback mechanisms. Loading states and error boundaries provide comprehensive user feedback during asynchronous operations.
